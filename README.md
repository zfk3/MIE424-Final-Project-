# MIE424-Final-Project
OPTIMIZING FOR FAIRNESS IN MACHINE LEARNING

#### Developed by Sajad Hashemi, Zahra Nadine Kandola, Scott Oxholm, and Rachael Walker

## Overview:
This repo is tangental to our paper for our MIE424 Final Project. In this project, we study the effects of adding fairness regularizers to the objective function when training binary classification models. Our goals are twofold. First, we seek to examine the fairness-accuracy tradeoffs of regularizing for a single definition of fairness. We then extend the literature by exploring the effectiveness  of regularizing for multiple definitions of fairness simultaneously.
